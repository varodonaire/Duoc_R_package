\title{Calculate Proportion of Data Within Standard Deviation Multiples from the Mean}
\usage{
proportion_around_the_mean(data, sd_multiple = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector containing the data points.}

\item{sd_multiple}{A numeric value or vector indicating the multiples of the standard deviation to consider
from the mean. Must be non-negative.}
}
\value{
If `sd_multiple` is a single number, returns a single numeric value representing the proportion of data
points within that range. If `sd_multiple` is a vector, returns a list where each element corresponds to a
`sd_multiple` value and contains the mean, standard deviation, lower bound, upper bound, and proportion of data
points within the range.
}
\description{
This function calculates the proportion of data points within a specified number of standard deviations from the mean.
It supports both single and multiple standard deviation values. For multiple values, it returns a detailed list
of proportions and their corresponding bounds.
}
\examples{
data <- rnorm(1000)
single_proportion <- proportion_around_the_mean(data, 1)
multiple_proportions <- proportion_around_the_mean(data, c(1, 2, 3))
